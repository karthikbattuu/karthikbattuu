Hey there! 👋

<br>

Hi, I'm Karthik Battu. I'm a passionate data analyst from India. 📌

I specialize in data cleaning, data analysis, and data storytelling through impactful visualizations. Along with being an analyst, I also enjoy learning new technologies, improving systems, and building meaningful things on the internet.

I'm fascinated by how data drives business decisions and sparks innovation. I aim to combine my analytical skills, PMO experience, and passion for working with data to create real value for organizations and the world.

Outside of work, I love playing video games and travelling.
